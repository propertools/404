# 404 Fellowship — 2026 Season

Static. Sovereign. Slightly unhinged.

This page illustrates how contributions are evaluated.

We do **not** use points.
We use four dimensions.

Small changes can score highly.
Refactors are respected.
Noise is not rewarded.

## 🧭 The Four Dimensions

Each merged PR is evaluated across:

| Dimension      | Scale                                   | What It Means                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **#awesome**   | meh / wow / by Turing’s beard           | Did it create delight or impact?                      |
| **#craft**     | loose / solid / surgical                | How clean and careful was the execution?              |
| **#coherence** | random / aligned / disturbingly aligned | Does it fit the tone and purpose of the 404 page?     |
| **#entropy**   | contained / playful / destabilizing     | Did it increase chaos responsibly — or unnecessarily? |

This is not a competition.
This is a classification ritual.

# 🚫 Example of a Rejected PR (Educational)

| Contributor     | PR Summary                                                   | Outcome                 | Why                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **@xsl-wizard** | Implemented a Brainfuck compiler in XSLT inside the 404 page | Rejected (respectfully) | Brilliant. Completely unnecessary. Violates “static, readable, no obfuscation” rule. Also nobody asked for this. |

Comment from maintainers:

> This is technically impressive and mildly terrifying.
> However, it introduces interpretive complexity, violates readability expectations,
> and creates entropy without increasing coherence.
> We salute the ambition. We decline the merge.

No shame.
No drama.
Just boundaries.

# 🧠 Teenager Explanation (Plain Version)

If you are a student and reading this:

We are not grading how much code you write.

We are asking:

* Did you make something better?
* Did you make something clearer?
* Did you understand the vibe?
* Did you avoid breaking everything?

If yes — you’re doing it right.

---

# 🐾 Final Note

Be respectful.
Be funny.
Be exquisite.
Be kind.

If you can’t manage all four, aim for at least two.
