# Contributing to Proper Tools 404

Thank you for reading the source.

This repository is a deliberately static, dependency-free 404 artifact.
It is also a quiet recruiting surface.

Please keep contributions aligned with the spirit of the project.

## Ground Rules

- Static only. No build step.
- No external JS dependencies.
- No analytics, tracking, or beacons.
- No CDNs.
- Keep it readable for students.
- Keep it weird — but intentional.

If a change adds more than ~50KB of JavaScript, justify it clearly.

## Local Development

Preferred:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
